Another participant highlighted the importance of AI as a tool that should not interfere with fundamental human activities, asserting, 'AI must be a tool for us. Safe, and one that doesn't harm us or interfere with fundamental human activities.' Concerns about AI replacing human roles and decision-making were also evident, with one participant warning, 'if AI replaces humans or AI starts to take decisions without human intervention then it's going to be very dangerous for humanity.' Additionally, some participants noted limitations in the survey design, such as the lack of options like 'I don't know,' which may not accommodate all perspectives, particularly for introverted or autistic individuals. Despite these concerns, a notable number of participants felt they were able to express their opinions fully, with responses such as 'I was able to express my opinions fully' and 'I think I was able to express everything asked.' Overall, the responses underscore a mix of optimism and caution regarding AI, alongside feedback on the survey's design and inclusivity."
