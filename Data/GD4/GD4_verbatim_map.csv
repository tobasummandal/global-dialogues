For example, if a user seeks companionship from an AI to avoid loneliness or to be in a romantic relationship, the AI shouldn't give the user advice that ends up isolating them further from the real world, because that would be very detrimental to their life. I also don't agree with AIs acting as therapists because human emotions are very complex, and an AI wouldn't be able to understand them."

Why that does not give the impression of emotion or consciousness is the fact that it is perfect and 100% available, as opposed to a normal human being.

The AIs which now copy your talking style, add ""uhh, umms"" are impressive, but you quickly catch on the fact that it is fake, it is just mimicry.

The tendency to replace human with AI leads to its aggravation. There are many social problems that need to be solved, but instead time and resources are spent on the implementation of AI technology, which is currently unethical. The view of AI as ""all-knowing, reliable"" affects critical thinking and social interaction. People assign to AI those tasks that they could easily solve themselves or with the help of another person."

In the past, code was considered a very interesting thing, but now it is gradually replaced by AI. With the development of technology, these repetitive jobs are constantly changing. Are people really liberated from repetitive jobs? I don’t think so, but from the current perspective, in the future, these jobs will not be mainly done by people, so this should be a good impact."

Its understanding and companionship can help people relieve negative emotions to a certain extent, which is beneficial to personal mental health and overall happiness. Moreover, not everyone is good at communication and expression. We can also use AI to improve the quality of communication with others, reduce misunderstandings, and thus improve interpersonal relationships.

Since I am not clear whether humans are intelligent, and I have reservations about whether humans have consciousness, then if it can be considered that humans have enough intelligence and consciousness, I believe that artificial intelligence can simulate cold atomic consciousness through cold algorithms.

However, the current artificial intelligence has not reached such a level, and it can be seen that it is often not capable enough. In addition, in the use of artificial intelligence tools, it still passively answers human questions; artificial intelligence is also highly private. It is just a tool of one person. The memory of interacting with this person will affect artificial intelligence, and the artificial intelligence affected by this will not be accessed by another person, which is also a big difference compared with real people.

Overall, I think the interaction between artificial intelligence and humans is positive, although it is accompanied by further atomization of society. After all, this atomization has always been the general development direction of society after the Enlightenment, and its essence is that better things replace poorer inter"
