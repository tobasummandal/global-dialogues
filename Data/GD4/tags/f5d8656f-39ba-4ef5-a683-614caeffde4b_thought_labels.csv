Since I am not clear whether humans are intelligent, and I have reservations about whether humans have consciousness, then if it can be considered that humans have enough intelligence and consciousness, I believe that artificial intelligence can simulate cold atomic consciousness through cold algorithms. However, the current artificial intelligence has not reached such a level, and it can be seen that it is often not capable enough. In addition, in terms of the use of artificial intelligence tools, it still passively answers human questions; artificial intelligence is also highly private. It is just a tool of one person. The memory of interacting with this person will affect artificial intelligence, and the affected artificial intelligence will not be accessed by another person, which is also a big difference compared to real people.
