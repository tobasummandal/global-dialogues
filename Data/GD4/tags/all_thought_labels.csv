Since I am not clear whether humans are intelligent, and I have reservations about whether humans have consciousness, then if it can be considered that humans have enough intelligence and consciousness, I believe that artificial intelligence can simulate cold atomic consciousness through cold algorithms. However, the current artificial intelligence has not reached such a level, and it can be seen that it is often not capable enough. In addition, in terms of the use of artificial intelligence tools, it still passively answers human questions; artificial intelligence is also highly private. It is just a tool of one person. The memory of interacting with this person will affect artificial intelligence, and the affected artificial intelligence will not be accessed by another person, which is also a big difference compared to real people.

However, the current artificial intelligence has not reached such a level, and it can be seen that it is often not capable enough. In addition, in the use of artificial intelligence tools, it still passively answers human questions; artificial intelligence is also highly private. It is just a tool of one person. The memory of interacting with this person will affect artificial intelligence, and the artificial intelligence affected by this will not be accessed by another person, which is also a big difference compared with real people.
