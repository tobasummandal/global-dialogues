Since I am not clear whether humans are intelligent, and I have reservations about whether humans have consciousness, then if it can be considered that humans have enough intelligence and consciousness, I believe that artificial intelligence can simulate cold atomic consciousness through cold algorithms.

However, the current artificial intelligence has not reached such a level, and it can be seen that it is often not capable enough. In addition, in the use of artificial intelligence tools, it still passively answers human questions; artificial intelligence is also highly private. It is just a tool of one person. The memory of interacting with this person will affect artificial intelligence, and the artificial intelligence affected by this will not be accessed by another person, which is also a big difference compared with real people.

Overall, I think the interaction between artificial intelligence and humans is positive, although it is accompanied by further atomization of society. After all, this atomization has always been the general development direction of society after the Enlightenment, and its essence is that better things replace poorer interpersonal relationships. Although the fact of being replaced is regrettable, whether it is because of respecting human freedom or accepting the law of replacement of the old with the new, I accept this future and think it is a better future overall.",52,0.4000,0.4500,0.4700,0.5000,0.5200,0.5500,0.5700,0.5800,0.5900,0.6000,0.6400
